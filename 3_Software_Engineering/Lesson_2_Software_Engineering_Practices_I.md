## Clean and Modular Code
### Defs
* *Production code*: Software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note that this is different from production-quality code, which describes code that meets expectations for production in reliability, efficiency, and other aspects. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.
* *Clean code*: Code that is readable, simple, and concise. Clean production-quality code is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.
* *Modular code*: Code that is logically broken up into functions and modules. Modular production-quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable.
* *Module*: A file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.

## Refactoring Code
### Defs
* *Refactoring*: Restructuring your code to improve its internal structure without changing its external functionality. This gives you a chance to clean and modularize your program after you've got it working.
* Since it isn't easy to write your best code while you're still trying to just get it working, allocating time to do this is essential to producing high-quality code. Despite the initial time and effort required, this really pays off by speeding up your development time in the long run.
* You become a much stronger programmer when you're constantly looking to improve your code. The more you refactor, the easier it will be to structure and write good code the first time.
