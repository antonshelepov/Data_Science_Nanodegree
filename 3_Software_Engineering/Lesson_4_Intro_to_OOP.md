## Why Object-oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming, which is the programming style you most likely first learned. As you'll see in this lesson:
* Object-oriented programming allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time.
* Object-oriented programs hide the implementation from the end user.
